Git branching is a fundamental concept in the version control system Git. 
It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously and independently without interfering with each other's work. 
A branch in Git is essentially a separate line of development that stems from a common starting point.

Git command related to branching:
- git branch -> list all branch
- git branch branch_name -> create a new branch named branch_name
- git checkout branch_name -> switch to a existing branch branch_name
- git checkout -b branch_name -> create a new branch named branch_name and switch to this branch
